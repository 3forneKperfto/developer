- Cracking software is risky and unsafe. You might download malware or viruses that can harm your computer or compromise your data. You might also expose yourself to legal consequences if you are caught using pirated software.
- Cracking software is unreliable and inefficient. You might encounter errors, bugs, or compatibility issues that can affect the performance and functionality of the software. You might also miss out on updates, patches, or new features that can improve the software.

This way, you can enjoy all the benefits of the software without any risks or drawbacks. You can also get technical support, documentation, and customer service from the developers. You can also take advantage of the free trial period to test the software before buying it.
